# Kmean_Prolog
Kmean Clustering implementation in Prolog

# Requirements
This code was build using GNU Prolog and thus it is advisable to try testing this code on GNU Prolog

# How to test
* Clone the repository
* Open the km.pl file, the GNU Prolog console should pop up
* You can play around and test the code
* Example Input: `kmean([[1.0, 2.0], [2.0, 3.0], [3.0, 4.0], [4.0, 5.0], [5.0, 6.0]], 2, Clusters).`
* Example Output: `Clusters = [[[1.0, 2.0], [2.0, 3.0], [3.0, 4.0]], [[4.0, 5.0], [5.0, 6.0]]] `
